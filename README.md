# Bubberstation config overrides
On the live server these files replace any files of the same name within the config/ subfolder of the repo. 
This is necessary because testing on localhost necessarily requires different configs than the live servers.
To facilitate this this repo is pulled into GameStaticFiles/config/ by TGS at the end of every round(via a helper EventScript).

For players: You can make PRs here, but it is recommended to DM Zirok#7684 first.
